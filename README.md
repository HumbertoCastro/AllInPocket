## Features

All.Io offers the following main functionalities:

1. Weekly Task Organization: Users can add and edit tasks for their week and day, defining the schedule, name, and duration of each task. The tasks will be displayed on the user's screen, providing a clear overview of their daily schedule.

2. Note-Taking: The app provides a note-taking feature where users can create multiple note blocks. Each note block has a title, and by clicking on a note, users can access the text they have written within it. This feature helps users keep track of important information and ideas.

3. Financial Organization: All.Io allows users to manage their financial transactions by adding them monthly. Users can create expense categories, and when adding a transaction, the app automatically groups it by category. Users can add both positive transactions (e.g., income, sales) and negative transactions (e.g., utility bills, groceries). The app provides a summary of the monthly balance.

4. Weather Forecast (Upcoming): All.Io will soon include a weather forecast feature. It will display the weather information for your current location or the state you specify, providing you with valuable insights to plan your day accordingly.
